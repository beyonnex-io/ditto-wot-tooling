### WoT to OpenAPI Generator

The [WoT to OpenAPI Generator](wot-to-openapi-generator) is a Kotlin-based tool that converts WoT (Web of Things) 
Thing Models (JSON-LD format) into Eclipse Ditto OpenAPI 3.1.0 specifications.

It is available as command line interface (CLI) to be executed with `java -jar`, but can also be used as a 
library in your own applications.
